No static final string constants for reused strings (SpringBootPaymentsAppTests:27, SpringBootPaymentsAppTests:40) [Done]
- Poor unit test quality. Only full end to end tests. Just sends 2 basic rest requests. Didn't use AssertTrue (SpringBootPaymentsAppTests:46) [AssertEquals Done already]
- Controllers didnt need testing, services mostly did. But there are no isolated unit tests for them. [In-Progress]
- Autowired services are not final 
- Explicit diamond operator arguments (AccountController:56,68,84 etc) [???]
- Bad practice of loggers. Not self explaining, just random "method name" logs. (AccountController:54,55 etc) [Done]
- String concetanation in loggers. No string formatter. [
- String accountId, instead of a numeric one
- Poor quality javadocs. (AccountController:62,74,75,90,91 etc) 
- Identical, no self explaining custom exceptions
- Unused constructors (CustomerAccount) and methods in many places
- Using synchronized on a non-final variable (CustomerAccountDAO:142)
- Using synchronized in a getter ? (CustomerAccountDAO:142)
- Unnecessary assigning a map to an arraylist, and in a bad way (CustomerAccountDAO:144)
